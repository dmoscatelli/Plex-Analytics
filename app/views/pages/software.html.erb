                        <p>Making something simple is really hard. To us, simplicity is the absence of clutter — which can be difficult to achieve when designing software intended for user interaction. We do our best to ensure that every UI is simple to understand, and easy to use.

                        When a service is enabled, it should be upfront about what it’s doing, and why. We never sell or create software that is ambiguous as to its goal.

                        Many internet users find that over time their computers become loaded with unwanted software – be it adware, spyware or just plain junk. This is because a few applications they installed came bundled with junk, and that junk generated more junk piled higher and deeper. We believe any situation where multiple applications are being installed should be made very clear to users, so that if you were to ask them several months later – “What’s this?” – most will know where it came from and why it is there.

                        Usually there are complex business relationships among the companies participating in a bundle. This can result in well–intentioned companies benefiting from the distribution or revenue generated by software that does not benefit you.
