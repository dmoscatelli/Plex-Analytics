                        <h4>In a nutshell:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We value ideas over hierarchy—the best idea wins </li>
                            <li>You’re an Artist, not an employee</li>
                            <li>Our space is a campus, not an office </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>It’s really the people that make Plex the kind of company it is. We want to work with people who are smart and determined. We look for talent not experience which helps to facilitate an ever growing mix of new ideas. At Plex, everyone is an artist. The tools each of use to express our creativity vary with disposition—some use data, others use code.  Although Plex Artists share common goals and visions for the company, we hail from all walks of life.

                        <br>
                        We try our very best to maintain a university-like culture. We work together, have ‘class’ to learn new things, and look to everyone for big ideas and opinions.  Often, we try and stimulate intellectual debates about our products, services or just a new idea that some of us might have. Above all, we value ideas over hierarchy—the best idea wins.
